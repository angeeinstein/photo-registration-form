# Database Permission Issue & Delete Features

## Issues Fixed

### 1. SQLite Read-Only Database Error

**Problem:** 
```
sqlite3.OperationalError: attempt to write a readonly database
```

**Causes:**
- Database file permissions are read-only
- Database file doesn't exist yet and can't be created
- Parent directory doesn't have write permissions
- File is opened by another process with exclusive lock

**Solutions Implemented:**

1. **Improved `init_db()` function** - Added checks for:
   - Database directory creation
   - Write permission verification
   - Better error messages

2. **Test script created** - `test_db.py` to diagnose permission issues

**How to Fix:**

```powershell
# Option 1: If database exists but is read-only
attrib -r registrations.db

# Option 2: Delete and recreate (WARNING: This deletes all data!)
Remove-Item registrations.db -Force
python test_db.py

# Option 3: Check directory permissions
Get-Acl . | Format-List
```

## Testing

## Database Backup Recommendation

Before using delete features on production data:

```powershell
# Backup database
Copy-Item registrations.db registrations.db.backup

# If you need to restore
Copy-Item registrations.db.backup registrations.db -Force
```

---

## Usage Scenario: After Fair Completion

**Typical Workflow:**

1. **During Fair:**
   - Collect registrations
   - Send photos to participants

2. **After Fair Ends:**
   - Verify all photos have been sent
   - Download/backup database for records
   ```powershell
   Copy-Item registrations.db "backups/fair-2025-10-21.db"
   ```

3. **Clean Up for Next Fair:**
   - Go to Admin Dashboard
   - Scroll to "Danger Zone"
   - Type "DELETE ALL"
   - Confirm deletion
   - Database is now empty and ready for next fair

4. **Verify:**
   - Check dashboard shows 0 registrations
   - Ready for next event!

## Email Account Settings

**New Feature:** Select default email accounts for different purposes

**Location:** Admin ‚Üí Settings

**Options:**
1. **Confirmation Emails Account:** Used for automatic confirmation emails
2. **Photo Emails Account:** Default account for sending photos

**How It Works:**
- Select account from dropdown (shows all active accounts)
- Choose "Use System Default" to use the default marked account
- Settings are stored in database
- Can still override on dashboard when sending individual emails

**Priority Order:**
1. Manually selected account (on dashboard)
2. Account selected in settings
3. System default account (marked with ‚òÖ)
4. First active account

---

## Troubleshooting

### "readonly database" error

1. Check file exists and permissions:
```powershell
Get-ChildItem registrations.db | Select-Object Name, IsReadOnly
```

2. Remove read-only attribute:
```powershell
attrib -r registrations.db
```

3. Check directory permissions:
```powershell
Get-Acl . | Format-List
```

### Delete button doesn't work

- Check JavaScript console for errors (F12)
- Verify route is registered in `app.py`
- Check that form submission isn't blocked

### Confirmation dialog not showing

- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify `confirmDeleteAll()` function is defined
- Make sure script tag is closed properly

## Security Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Security Considerations:**

1. **No Undo:** Deleted registrations cannot be recovered (unless you have backups)
2. **Login Required:** All admin routes require authentication
3. **Confirmation Required:** Delete all requires exact text match
4. **Two-Step Process:** Both text input AND dialog confirmation needed
5. **Audit Log:** Consider adding logging for deletions (future enhancement)

---

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements:

1. **Soft Delete:** Mark as deleted instead of permanent removal
2. **Audit Log:** Track who deleted what and when
3. **Export Before Delete:** Automatically backup before bulk delete
4. **Recycle Bin:** Temporarily store deleted items for recovery
5. **Scheduled Cleanup:** Auto-delete after certain time period
6. **Bulk Operations:** Select specific registrations to delete

---

## Questions?

If you encounter any issues:

1. Run `python test_db.py` to diagnose database problems
2. Check file permissions with PowerShell commands above
3. Look at Flask error logs
4. Check browser console (F12) for JavaScript errors
